The goal is to predict the urgency with which a COVID-19 patient will need to be admitted to the hospital from the time of onset of symptoms. The dataset contains some COVID-19 symptoms and demographic information.  This dataset was collected in the peak of a COVID-19 wave and hence may have some errors and missing data. The aim of this exercise is to pre-process the given data and create a clean dataset to use for modelling and inference. Additionally, you are required to perform some EDA to understand the data better.
